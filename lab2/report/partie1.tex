\subsection{Aim}

This second lab session explores the concept of graph search algorithms. The
agent is still a Vacuum cleaner evolving in a simple grid.
Each square of that grid is either clean filled with dirt, or a wall.
The vacuum cleaner uses search algorithm to locate the dirt squares.
The purpose of this lab is to write our own implementation of
\textit{Breadth First Search} and \textit{Depth First Search} algorithms which
inherit from a \textit{CustomGraphSearch} class.

Using the Java GUI included in the project files, it is possible to compare the
efficiency of differents search algorithms : BFS, DFS, IDS, A*.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Turning 90Â° in the given direction (\textit{uMovement equal to 0})
%  \item Moving forward, down to the next grid line (\textit{uMovement equal to 1})
%  \item Turning again in the same direction (\textit{uMovement equal to 0 again})
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation}

Given that the course book and the slides provide us with pseudo code of the
algorithms, it is easier to realize the implementation.
